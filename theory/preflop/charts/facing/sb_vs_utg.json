  "description": "SB facing UTG open — very tight defense, mostly 3-bet or fold, occasional cold-call with suited hands.",
  "theory": "SB faces the tightest opening range in 6-max. Cold-calling is often suboptimal due to OOP play, so SB's flat range is narrow. 3-betting is preferred with strong hands.",

    "offsuit": [],
    "notes": "Cold-calling OOP vs UTG is marginal. Only very playable suited hands or pairs that don't want to 3-bet."
